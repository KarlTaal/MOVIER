# Movier

This project was created within the university course ***Mobile Computing and Internet of Things***. 
The idea is that two or more people can use this application to find a suitable movie for themselves.
First of all, one person creates a room where other participants can join using a 5-digit code.
After that, everyone chooses the genres they like. When everyone has made their choice, everyone begins to receive a description of the films,
including the rating and picture. Each person decides whether he wants to watch this film or not.
If everyone likes one movie, then everyone receives a notification that a match has occurred.
